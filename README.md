# Image-Classification
Cat - Dog Image Classifier

Get the dataset and template from http://www.superdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Convolutional_Neural_Networks.zip

I've limited resources so restricted epochs to 25 only...If you have a good GPU like Nvidia GTX1080, 100 epochs is a good number.

# Soon,this project will be available in Pytorch too!!!
